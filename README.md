## 💡 About the Project  
I actually created this project a while ago but decided to finally upload it now!  

This game was built completely from scratch using **pure JavaScript**, without any libraries or frameworks.  
It helped me deeply understand how **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **logic flow** work together to create an interactive experience.  

I spent a lot of time refining every detail — from smooth button flashes to handling the game-over sequence — to make it feel engaging and polished.

## 🕹️ How to Play  
1. Press any key to start the game.  
2. Watch the color sequence carefully.  
3. Repeat the same sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.  
4. Each new level adds one more color to the sequence.  
5. If you click the wrong color — game over! Your score will be displayed, and you can restart anytime.
